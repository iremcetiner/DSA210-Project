# Weather Temperature Impact on Daily Stress Levels

# Project Overview
In this project, I aim to observe if there is a relation between my daily stress levels and weather temperature or not. Over the next one month, I am planning on monitoring my stress levels 4 times a day through my smart watch and also noting the temperature and weather condition at the moment that I am recording my stress levels. I will also include the days of the week as a factor for this experiment. This project will involve data collection, explaratory data analysis, feature engineering and visualization techniques.

# Objectives
* Identify Stress Level Influencers: Observe the relationship between the day of the week, time of the day, temperature, weather condition and my stress levels.
* Detect Key Factors: Determine key factors that have the strongest impact on relatively lower stress levels.
* Applying Data Science Skills: Implement skills I have attained through DSA 210 course to improve my life quality. 
* Data-Driven Improving: Using the results from the analysis, I will work on improving my low stress levels according to the key factors that  influence my stress levels.

# Motivation
I have been struggling with anxiety for years and I really want to do something for it all by myself. I want to see if I can somehow manage it by knowing the factors that have an impact on it. Thus, I will be one step ahead on learning how to improve my life quality on my own.

# Dataset
The dataset consists of factors such as day of the week including the date, temperature, weather condition, time of the day and my stress levels.
The data will be collected from the following sources:
* Apple Weather App: I will collect temperature and weather condition data from the Weather App of my Apple device.
* Smartphone: The data of date and time of the day will be collected from my smartphone.
* Stress Levels: I will track my stress levels in the morning, afternoon, evening and at night each day through my smart watch.

# Plan
1. Data Collection: Data will be collected over the next one month maintaining consistent times of the day and ensuring data consistency.
2. Data Preperation and Analysis: Data will be reviewed for consistency and completeness at the end of the collection process. Exploratory Data Analysis will be conducted by identifying trends using statistical methods and visualization techniques. Regression Analysis will be made by applying Statistical Methods to study the the influence of different factors on stress levels. 

# Hypothesis
* Null Hypothesis (H₀): There is no significant relationship between temperature, weather condition and stress levels. Increase in temperature and improvement in weather condition do not significantly affect stress levels throughout the day.
* Alternative Hypothesis (Hₐ): There is a significant relationship between various factors and daily stress levels. As temperature increases and weather condition improves, daily stress levels decrease.
